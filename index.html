      As a unique and complex individual with my own thoughts, feelings, experiences, and goals, I firmly believe in the power of "I am". A self-affirmation that acknowledges my capacity for significant 
      accomplishments and my potential to exert a positive influence on the world. I am passionate about organizing, being creative, and coming up with new ideas and I'm always willing to help others. 
      As humans, we are not perfectionists, however I consider myself to be a bootleg perfectionists, because I accept and value my failures. My values and beliefs are important to me and I believe it 
      is important to treat others with kindness and respect.I want to use my creativity and skills to do it. I continue to learn about myself every day, but I'm excited to see what my future holds.

      As a Data Science student, my interest in web development stems from a unique blend of personal attributes and aspirations. These tools can be incredibly effective for helping people understand 
      and learn from data. For example, I could create a web dashboard that visualizes data on the spread of disease, or I could build an interactive data visualization that allows people to explore 
      the relationships between different variables.
