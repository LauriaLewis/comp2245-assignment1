      As a unique and complex individual with my own thoughts, feelings, experiences, and goals, I believe that "I am". I am capable of great things, and I have the potential to make a positive 
      impact on the world. I am passionate about organizing, being creative, and coming up with new ideas. I'm always willing to help others. As humans, we are not perfectionists, but at times, 
      I strive to be and then get a but too hard on myself. My values and beliefs are important to me and I believe it is important to treat others with kindness and respect.My goals and dreams 
      are to make a positive impact in the world. I want to use my creativity and skills to do it. I continue to learn about myself every day, but I'm excited to see what my future holds.
